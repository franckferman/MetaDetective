## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- Docker must be installed on your machine.
- While the Docker image can technically be run on Windows, the provided scripts are written in Bash. Thus, they are designed for environments that support Bash scripting, like Linux.

### Building the Docker Image <a name="building-the-docker-image"></a>

To build and run the Docker image:
```bash
sudo ./start.sh
```

When executed, this script performs the following actions:
1. It checks if the metadetective-image already exists. If it doesn't, the script builds one using the provided Dockerfile.
2. It runs a container named metadetective-container.
3. Upon completion, you'll be placed inside the container shell, where you're ready to start using MetaDetective.

### Stopping and Removing Containers and Images <a name="stopping-and-removing-containers-and-images"></a>

In case you want to stop the running container and/or remove the Docker image:
```bash
sudo ./remove.sh
```

Executing this script will:
1. Stop and remove the metadetective-container if it's currently running.
2. Prompt you with the option to delete the metadetective-image.

## Dockerfile Details <a name="dockerfile-details"></a>

Our Docker image is built upon the lightweight foundation of `debian:bullseye-slim`. 

The following essential packages are installed:

`python3`: The core programming language for running MetaDetective.

`python3-pip`: Used specifically to fetch and install the MetaDetective release directly from PyPI.

`libimage-exiftool-perl`: MetaDetective partly relies on this tool for metadata extraction and analysis.

Due to the ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:${PATH}" setting in the Dockerfile, you can directly launch MetaDetective within the container without needing to navigate to any specific directory. Simply invoke MetaDetective followed by the desired command-line arguments.
